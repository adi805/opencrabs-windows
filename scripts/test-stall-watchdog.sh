#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-stall-watchdog.sh: run a command (the test suite), and if it freezes,
# say so with thread stacks instead of silence (#1936).
#
# The gate has burned its whole timeout with every test-thread slot blocked
# and no verdict: the runner kills the job, so the blocked stacks are never
# dumped. This wrapper watches the command's own log for completed-test
# lines. Once tests are reporting results, a gap of WATCHDOG_STALL_SECS with
# no new result line is declared a stall: every descendant process gets a
# thread dump, its subtree is killed, and the script exits 97 with a
# "STALL DETECTED" marker, so the failure surfaces minutes after it starts
# instead of at the runner's wall.
#
# Before the first result line the stall clock does not run: the same
# command legitimately spends 20+ cold-cache minutes in "Compiling", and
# killing a build would misdiagnose a lock bug as a timeout.
#
# Test seams (unset in CI; src/tests/test_stall_watchdog_test.rs uses them):
#   WATCHDOG_STALL_SECS - stall threshold, seconds (default 240)
#   WATCHDOG_POLL_SECS  - poll interval, fractions allowed (default 2)
#   WATCHDOG_DUMP_ON    - file appended per dump (empty disables)
#   WATCHDOG_DUMPER     - command prefix used to dump a pid, called as
#                         "$WATCHDOG_DUMPER <pid>"; default is per-OS
#                         (lldb on macOS, gdb on Linux, none elsewhere)
