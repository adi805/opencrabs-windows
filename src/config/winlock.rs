//! Windows backend for the advisory locks that [`flock`](super::flock)
//! provides on Unix, plus the one process-stop primitive the preempt path
//! needs there.
//!
//! The kernel32 bindings are declared by hand, matching the existing
//! precedent in this module tree (`is_pid_alive` in `profile.rs` declares
//! `OpenProcess`/`CloseHandle` the same way). That is deliberate: the lock
//! needs exactly three functions, and pulling `windows-sys` in as a direct
//! dependency would churn `Cargo.lock` — which CI pins with `--locked` — for
//! a couple dozen lines of signatures the codebase already writes this way.
//!
//! Semantics mirrored from Unix:
//! * Mutual-exclusion lock = `LockFileEx` with `LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK`
//!   over a *sentinel range* (one byte at 1 MiB, past any stamp), not the
//!   literal whole file: an exclusive range also blocks READS by other
//!   handles inside it, and the lock-file's `profile:pid` stamp at offset 0
//!   must stay readable by the contender that reports `Held` (the owner-PID
//!   message depends on it). Ranges past EOF are lockable by design, so the
//!   contention semantics are identical while the stamp stays visible.
//! * `LOCK_NB` = `LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY`; contention reports `Held`,
//!   exactly like `FlockOutcome::Held`, so callers keep identical arms.
//! * Release on handle drop: the OS clears range locks when the file handle
//!   closes. [`unlock`] exists for explicit release with a loggable error.
//!
//! Cross-platform caveat, by design: a Unix flock and a Windows range lock
//! on the same file do not see each other. Both families are only ever
//! contended by two OpenCrabs instances on one machine, and a Windows build
//! never executes the Unix code path, so the split is safe as long as no
//! caller mixes them.
