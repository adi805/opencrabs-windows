//! Collapsible tool-call group for Slack, the Telegram `<blockquote
//! expandable>` equivalent. Slack has no native collapsed quote, so the
//! grouped message renders a summary line with an Expand button; clicking
//! it flips the stored group state and re-renders the SAME message with
//! the full tool list and a Collapse button. State lives in
//! [`super::SlackState`] keyed by the group message's ts so the
//! interaction handler can re-render long after the turn's closures are
//! gone. Expansion is per-message, not per-viewer: everyone in the
//! channel sees the same state (one shared message).
//!
//! The summary line carries the flow status (#1797): an always-on
//! tool-call counter, a live `🕒` clock while the turn runs, and a settled
//! terminal line (`✅ Finished · N tool calls · ctx · ⏱`) stamped at
//! delivery: the Slack twin of Telegram's flow header/footer.
