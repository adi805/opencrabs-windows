//! The Discord session turn slot and the mid-turn follow-up queue (#1990).
//!
//! Telegram's `active_turns` / `pending_reactions` twin (#501, #1213, #1837).
//! Two facts made this necessary: `store_cancel_token` CANCELS the token it
//! finds (`cancel.rs`), so a second inbound message on a busy session killed
//! the live or recovered turn; and the follow-up had nowhere to queue, so it
//! forked a second concurrent tool loop on the same session, whose answer
//! read the first turn's prompt as "another task in flight" and said so
//! (#1990). The slot makes the claim atomic; the queue gives the loser
//! somewhere to wait: injected between tool rounds by the queue callback,
//! flushed into a fresh tracked turn by whoever held the slot last.
