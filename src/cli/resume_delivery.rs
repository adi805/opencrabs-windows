//! Delivery for boot-revived turns (#1950, #1952).
//!
//! The generic resume arm used to end with a chain of `if let ... && let ...`
//! guards and no else: if the channel's transport was not connected when the
//! revived turn finished (likely, since nothing orders the recovery pass
//! against the channel's own connect), the generated answer was dropped with
//! zero log lines. And `boot_report::record_delivered()` fired before the
//! send was even attempted, so the boot ledger counted those drops as
//! delivered. Two drop tests on 2026-10-05: 2 answers generated, 0 delivered,
//! 0 errors logged.
//!
//! The whole revived-turn task lives here so delivery, announcements and
//! counting are one auditable unit. Sends wait for the transport within the
//! bounded grace (#1242 pattern), every skip path logs loudly, the ledger
//! counts outcomes rather than intentions, and the channel gets a visible
//! "continuing your interrupted turn" notice as soon as it wakes.
