//! Deterministic Sources footer (#1883).
//!
//! Search-backed answers carried source links only when the model felt like
//! citing them. This module harvests the URLs the search tools already render
//! into their own output (`🔗` / `URL:` lines) and appends a bounded markdown
//! link list to the delivered final answer at the turn's settle point, so a
//! search-backed reply always carries its sources without model cooperation.
//! URLs the answer already links are dropped rather than repeated.
